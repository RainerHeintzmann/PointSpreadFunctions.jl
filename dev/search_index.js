Most of the parameters (such as refractive index, numerical aperture, vacuum wavelength, aberrations etc.) are hidden in the  parameter structure argument pp, which should be generated via the PSFParams() constructor. See `PSFParams() for details.\n\nParameters\n\nsz:         size tuple of the final PSF\npp:         PSF parameters of the PSF. See PSFParams() for details.

This should include the excitation wavelength as well as typically aplanatic=aplanatic_illumination.\npinhole=nothing:    The diameter of the pinhole in Airy Units (AU = 1.22 λ/NA). A pinhole size of one AU corresponds to a pinhole border falling onto the first zero of a corresponding paraxial emission PSF.\nsampling=nothing:   The sampling parameters of the resulting PSF.\nuse_resampling=true: Exploits a calculation trick, which first calculates the individual PSFs on a twice coarser grid in XY and Z and then upsamples the result.

But warnings will then result during the calculations of the subsampled widefield PSFs.\nreturn_amp=false:    Has to be false since confocal amplitude spread functions do not exist for non-zero pinhole sizes. \npinhole_positions=[(0.0,0.0)]:  A list of pinhole positions in pixels. One PSF will be returned for each pinhole position. If only a single pinhole position is supplied the PSF will directly be returned instead of a vector of PSFs. Specifies the precise position(s) of the pinholes in the detection path. This allows to simulate an offset (misadjusted) pinhole, or (as a vector of tuples) a PSF for a whole set of positions. See the psf(ModeISM, ...) for more details. \npinhole_ft=disc_pinhole_ft:  Specifies which function is used to calculate the Fourier transform of the pinhole. This allows the user to control the pinhole shape. \nex_modifier:   A function that can modify the excitation PSF. By default the identity is used, but other options are modify_square to calculate a two-photon confocal PSF. However, you should typically use the Mode2Photon to do this. Note that the order of the PSFParams are reversed.

Not that the coordinate system refers to the detection PSF. The NA of the  excitation PSF refers to the Z and Y direction. The polarisation of the excitation PSF along X means along Z and along Y means along Y in the final volume. Note that the excitation is assumed for the best focus position (beam waist). In reality the PSF will be spatially dependent due to the excitation focus.\n\nParameters\n\nsz:         size tuple of the final PSF\npp_em:      PSF parameters of the emission PSF.

Note that this may be inappropriate due to undersampling due to the Stokes shift which is neglected here. But warnings will then result during the calculations of the subsampled widefield PSFs.\n'dynamically_scanned': specifies, whether the lightsheet uses a dynamically scanned beam. This is important for the calculation of the PSF. If the beam is scanned, the PSF will be calculated in the same way as for a confocal PSF. If the beam is not scanned, the excitation PSF will be assuming a focussing via a cylinder lens.\nex_modifier:   A function that can modify the excitation PSF. By default the identity is used, but other options are modify_square to calculate a two-photon confocal PSF. However, you should typically use the Mode2Photon to do this. Note that the order of the PSFParams are reversed.   By default (modify_ident), no modication is performed.\nsigmaz = nothing: If the user provides a sigmaz value, the excitation calculation is using a Guassian excitation PSF with the specified sigma. pp_ex is ignored.\n\njulia> pp_em = PSFParams(0.5,0.9,1.33; mode=ModeLightsheet);\njulia> pp_ex = PSFParams(0.488, 0.2, 1.33);\njulia> p_lightsheet = psf((128,128,128), pp_em; pp_ex=pp_ex, sampling=(0.040,0.040,0.100), dynamically_scanned=true);\njulia> p_lightsheet_gauss = psf((128,128,128), pp_em; sampling=(0.040,0.040,0.100), sigma_z=1.0); # Gaussian excitation PSF\n\n\n\n\n\npsf(::Type{ModeISM}, sz::NTuple, pp_em::PSFParams; pinhole=nothing, sampling=nothing, pinhole_ft=box_pinhole_ft, pinhole_positions=[(0.0,0.0)], pinhole_dist=0.5, pinhole_grid=(5,5), ism_pos=ism_positions_rect, args...)\n\nCalculates a confocal point spread function.

The terms I0, I1 and I2 are first calculated for an radial Z-dependet profile and then interpolated onto the 3D volume.\naplanatic:    aplanatic factor. Provided as a function of angle θ.

Aplanatic factors as for aplanatic optical systems fullfilling the Abbe sine condition are accounted for as well as various pupil properties can be supplied.  Different modes of calculation are possible and more will be added in the future. Aberrations can be specified in terms of Zernike coefficients.","category":"page"}]
